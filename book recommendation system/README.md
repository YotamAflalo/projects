# Book Recommendation System

## Introduction
This project implements a Book Recommendation System using various machine learning techniques. The goal is to provide users with personalized book recommendations based on their preferences and interactions with the system.

## Technologies Used
The system is implemented in Python, leveraging popular libraries for data analytics and machine learning. The primary technologies include:

- **Python:** The core programming language for implementing the recommendation system.

- **Data Analytics and Science Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn are used for data manipulation, analysis, and modeling.

- **Matrix Factorization:** Techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or Alternating Least Squares (ALS) are employed for collaborative filtering.

- **One-Class SVM:** Anomaly detection using One-Class Support Vector Machines for identifying unusual patterns in user behavior.

- **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow and Keras are utilized for building and training neural network models for recommendation.

## Project Structure

- **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and ensure data quality.

- **Matrix Factorization:** The collaborative filtering approach involves factorizing the user-item interaction matrix to uncover latent features.

- **One-Class SVM:** Anomaly detection helps identify unusual user behavior or outliers in the dataset.

- **Deep Learning Models:** Neural network models, such as a basic collaborative filtering model and an enhanced model with additional features, are implemented using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Ensure your dataset is preprocessed and formatted correctly.

2. **Matrix Factorization:**
   - Execute the Matrix Factorization script to generate collaborative filtering recommendations.

3. **One-Class SVM:**
   - Run the One-Class SVM script to identify outliers or unusual patterns in user behavior.

4. **Deep Learning Models:**
   - Train the deep learning models by running the respective scripts for basic collaborative filtering and enhanced models.

5. **Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate metrics.

6. **Integration:**
   - Integrate the best-performing models into the main recommendation system.
